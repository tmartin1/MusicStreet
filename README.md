# Music Street
The inspiration for Music Street comes from my encounters with various street musicians. I love music and have seen some incredibly talented street musicians. I initially wanted to (somehow) have the ability to offer them recording sessions so they can make CDs to sell. I've seen so many talented street musicians in just Seattle and San Francisco that I thought it would be really amazing to share them with the rest of the world, and create an opportunity to get to see some of the other great performers from around the world too.

The goal for Music Street would be to create a community of street musicians and music lovers. Music lovers would be able to explore and discover great musicians from all over the world, while the musicians get to expand their audience to a global scale.

As many street musicians don't have the ability to make high-quality recordings of their music, this would be highly community dependent and rely heavily on good will of others to help get talented musicians access to recording and uploading their music.
